### Hey there, it's me, Naresh! 
If I helped you out in any way, you could [buy me a beer on Ko-fi üçªüçª](https://ko-fi.com/nareshkumarrao) 

#### Projects I wanna üíñ show off üíñ:

- [**Robo-Arm**](https://github.com/naresh97/Robo-Arm)

  Still very much a work in progress, but I'm trying to squeeze as much of my C++ knowledge into it as possible! ü§ì I'm building a small tabletop robot arm that I running of an STM32 with the software in this repository. I'm writing a lot of utility code to interface with FreeRTOS and STM's HAL to create clean interfaces that I can use in my application. And although not strictly necessary, I'm trying to get away with using no (or as little as possible) dynamic memory allocation. I'm also really trying to push Static Polymorphism as much as possible, using C++20 Concepts. Oh, and did I mention it's using C++20? üòÅ

- [**EI Weblog Android**](https://github.com/naresh97/ei-weblog-android)

  So my faculty has this web blog where they push important updates all the time. The only problem is that it has **no notifications** üò¢. Login every morning into the weblog to check for updates? Nah! I made an Android app that scraped the web blog and give you notifications. Problem solved! As a bonus, it can scrape your grades and give you notifications for those too ü§ì
  
- [**OurSejahtera**](https://github.com/naresh97/our-sejahtera)

  There was a civil society protest in Malaysia a while ago, and since it was in the middle of the pandemic, the organizers were looking for a way to do contact tracing without relying on government tools. So I developed a way that contact tracing can be done semi-anonymously, that way the protesters could keep themselves safe! The front-end is done in **React** and the background API server uses **Express**. 
  
- [**OpenProfinet**](https://github.com/naresh97/OpenProfinet)

  While doing my Master's Project, I was required to do a lot of configuring of Profinet devices. The problem? Most of the tools for the configuration (I believe the fancy industry word is _projecting_) are proprietary üò¢. The absolute **worst** part? Most only run on Windows. WINDOWS! So I had to create my own configuration tool. Written in ‚ú® **C++** ‚ú®

#### Showing off my ‚ú®**fancy**‚ú® **qualifications**, since I worked my ass off for them:

- M.Sc. Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (Automation) in 2022 from the University of Applied Sciences, D√ºsseldorf
- B.Eng. Physical Engineering in 2019 from the University of Applied Sciences, Aachen
