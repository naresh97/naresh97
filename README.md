### Hey there, it's me, Naresh! 
If I helped you out in any way, you could [buy me a beer on Ko-fi üçªüçª](https://ko-fi.com/nareshkumarrao) 

#### Projects I wanna üíñ show off üíñ:

- [**Advent of Code (Rust)**](https://github.com/naresh97/advent-of-code-2024)

  My solutions for the latest Advent of Code. I might be lagging a little behind because of the holidays üòÑ

- [**trojan-rs (Rust)**](https://github.com/naresh97/trojan-rs)

  A proxy client and server to circumvent censorship using the Trojan protocol. All the currently available options were too large to fit on a small router in an embedded environment, so I decided to write my own with the priority of reducing binary and memory footprint.

- [**GrowPi (Rust)**](https://github.com/naresh97/growpi)

  I wanted to create a little Growbox for my special *plants* that would provide them with a programmable amount of light and water! The perfect tool for a lazy gardener. My first fully-fledged project in **Rust** and I'm very happy with how it turned out. Built using a Raspberry Pi, some relays and other hardware store electronics!

- [**Robo-Arm (C++)**](https://github.com/naresh97/Robo-Arm)

  Still very much a work in progress, but I'm trying to squeeze as much of my C++ knowledge into it as possible! ü§ì I'm building a small tabletop robot arm that I running of an STM32 with the software in this repository. I'm writing a lot of utility code to interface with FreeRTOS and STM's HAL to create clean interfaces that I can use in my application. And although not strictly necessary, I'm trying to get away with using no (or as little as possible) dynamic memory allocation. I'm also really trying to push Static Polymorphism as much as possible, using C++20 Concepts. Oh, and did I mention it's using C++20? üòÅ
  
- [**OurSejahtera (JS)**](https://github.com/naresh97/our-sejahtera)

  There was a civil society protest in Malaysia a while ago, and since it was in the middle of the pandemic, the organizers were looking for a way to do contact tracing without relying on government tools. So I developed a way that contact tracing can be done semi-anonymously, that way the protesters could keep themselves safe! The front-end is done in **React** and the background API server uses **Express**. 
  
- [**OpenProfinet (C++)**](https://github.com/naresh97/OpenProfinet)

  While doing my Master's Project, I was required to do a lot of configuring of Profinet devices. The problem? Most of the tools for the configuration (I believe the fancy industry word is _projecting_) are proprietary üò¢. The absolute **worst** part? Most only run on Windows. WINDOWS! So I had to create my own configuration tool. Written in ‚ú® **C++** ‚ú®

#### Showing off my ‚ú®**fancy**‚ú® **qualifications**, since I worked my ass off for them:

- M.Sc. Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (Automation) in 2022 from the University of Applied Sciences, D√ºsseldorf
- B.Eng. Physical Engineering in 2019 from the University of Applied Sciences, Aachen
