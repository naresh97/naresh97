### Hey there, it's me, Naresh! 

#### Projects I wanna ðŸ’– show off ðŸ’–:
- [**EI Weblog Android**](https://github.com/naresh97/ei-weblog-android)

  So my faculty has this web blog where they push important updates all the time. The only problem is that it has **no notifications** ðŸ˜¢. Login every morning into the weblog to check for updates? Nah! I made an Android app that scraped the web blog and give you notifications. Problem solved! As a bonus, it can scrape your grades and give you notifications for those too ðŸ¤“
  
- [**OurSejahtera**](https://github.com/naresh97/our-sejahtera)

  There was a civil society protest in Malaysia a while ago, and since it was in the middle of the pandemic, the organizers were looking for a way to do contact tracing without relying on government tools. So I developed a way that contact tracing can be done semi-anonymously, that way the protesters could keep themselves safe! The front-end is done in **React** and the background API server uses **Express**. 
  
- [**OpenProfinet**](https://github.com/naresh97/OpenProfinet)

  While doing my Master's Project, I was required to do a lot of configuring of Profinet devices. The problem? Most of the tools for the configuration (I believe the fancy industry word is _projecting_) are proprietary ðŸ˜¢. The absolute **worst** part? Most only run on Windows. WINDOWS! So I had to create my own configuration tool. Written in âœ¨ **C++** âœ¨

#### Showing off my âœ¨**fancy**âœ¨ **qualifications**, since I worked my ass off for them:
- M.Sc. Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (Automation) in 2022 from the University of Applied Sciences, DÃ¼sseldorf
- B.Eng. Physical Engineering in 2019 from the University of Applied Sciences, Aachen
